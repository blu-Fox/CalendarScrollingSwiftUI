// Removal of conflict between scrollview and event view:
// (1) I tried using .updating and .onChange to update a specific variable when dragging/stretching. If the variable was on, scrollview would be off. However, this did not produce the intended result. After drag gesture ends, a subsequent attempt at a drag gesture scrolls the scrollview instead. Only holding for some time magically switches to the drag gesture
// (2) I tried moving the dragged view outside of the scrollview. This seems to be the case in iOS calendar. When we drag or expand, the original view stays in scrollview and slightly loses opacity, and a bright overlay appears over the scrollview. AND IT WORKS!!!1!!1!1!1!!1!1
// (3) However, we removed the event view from the parent coordinate space. So now, it cannot get the coordinates of Scrollview. To solve it, I tried passing the Scrollview frame around and into the event view. This indeed works.
// (4) However, gestures were still hardwired into the local space, which is what first appears on the screen. So I set gestures to the parent coordinate space. This made the numbers more sensible. A bigger problem was that event view refused to stretch beyond screen size - safe areas. It turns out the culprit was the parent ZStack of Calendar view, which contained everything and was just set to the default frame. Enlarging the frame for draggable view resolved this problem.
// (5) However, we now have new problems.
  //  (a) stretch gesture now continues beyond calendar view. I fixed it by limiting gesture to the visible part of calendar view (700).
  // (b) drag onChanged works fine, but onEnded has a weird frame: its minY is 100 larger, and its maxY 50 larger than Calendar view. This fixed itself after fixing (a).
  // (c) bottomStretch should be rewritten along the new implementation of topStretch. This was successfully rewritten.
// (6) Some small issue persists in bottomStretch.onEnded. For some reason, it refuses to auto-align to 1200. Turns out we only had 24 points, but we need 25: 0, and then a point at the end of each row.
// (7) Dragging and stretching now (FINALLY) works as it should. Time to make it a bit useful.
  // (a) First, we should clean all this up. Create a model (Event) and viewModel(s) (Protocols - come on, you wanna be a pro) to store all these values and functions.
  // (b) LongPress on calendar should show a DraggableEvent in that location, with possibility to move it around (like iOS).
  // (c) On Ended, draggable event should snap into place and turn into a "normal" event (at this point, iOS calendar brings up a sheet).
  // (d) LongPress elsewhere would repat the process.
  // (e) LongPress on "normal" event will bring up draggable event (normal event will dim slightly)
  // (f) If two "normal" events overlap, their position.x and width should change
#warning("To continue, see point 7 above.")
