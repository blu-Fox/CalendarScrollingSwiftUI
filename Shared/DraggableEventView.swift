//  Created by Jan Stehl√≠k on 30.07.2022.
//
// Abstract: View for a single event as part of the calendar timeline that we can drag around.

// MARK: Log of improvements to DraggableEventView. I am currently stuck at point 7a
// (1) SOLVED I tried using .updating and .onChange to update a specific variable when dragging/stretching. If the variable was on, scrollview would be off. However, this did not produce the intended result. After drag gesture ends, a subsequent attempt at a drag gesture scrolls the scrollview instead. Only holding for some time magically switches to the drag gesture. To solve this, I tried moving the dragged view outside of the scrollview. This seems to be the case in iOS calendar. When we drag or expand, the original view stays in scrollview and slightly loses opacity, and a bright overlay appears over the scrollview. This approach works!
// (2) SOLVED By solving (1), we removed the event view from the parent coordinate space. So now, it cannot get the coordinates of Scrollview. To solve it, I tried passing the Scrollview frame around and into the event view. This indeed works.
// (3) SOLVED After solving (1), gestures were still hardwired into the local space, which is what first appears on the screen. So I set gestures to the parent coordinate space. This made the numbers more sensible. A bigger problem was that event view refused to stretch beyond screen size - safe areas. It turns out the culprit was the parent ZStack of Calendar view, which contained everything and was just set to the default frame. Enlarging the frame for draggable view resolved this problem.
// (5) SOLVED Solving (3) created new problems.
  //  (a) stretch gesture continued beyond calendar view. I fixed it by limiting gesture to the visible part of calendar view (700).
  // (b) drag onChanged worked fine, but onEnded had a weird frame: its minY was 100 larger, and its maxY 50 larger than Calendar view. This fixed itself after fixing (a).
  // (c) bottomStretch had to be rewritten along the new implementation of topStretch. This was successfully rewritten.
// (6) SOLVED Some small issue persisted in bottomStretch.onEnded. For some reason, it refused to auto-align to 1200. Turns out we only had 24 points, but we need 25. That is, point 0 + a point at the end of each row.
// (7) TODO Dragging and stretching now works as it should. Next steps:
  // MARK: (a) Scrollview should scroll automatically if we're dragging the event near the top/bottom edge.
  // (b) LongPress on calendar should show a DraggableEvent in that location, with possibility to move it around (like iOS).
  // (c) On Ended, draggable event should snap into place and turn into a "normal" event (at this point, iOS calendar brings up a sheet).
  // (d) LongPress elsewhere would create another event.
  // (e) LongPress on "normal" event (i.e. event that is part of the timeline) will bring up a draggable event ("normal" event will dim slightly)
  // (f) If two "normal" events overlap, their position.x and width should change, so that both will exist side by side.
  // (g) We should clean up the code. Create a model (Event) and viewModel(s). Use protocols.
